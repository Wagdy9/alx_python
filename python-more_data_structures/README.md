## Introduction

Data structures are fundamental building blocks in computer science and software development. They allow us to efficiently organize and manipulate data, enabling faster algorithms and more optimized solutions. This project serves as a valuable resource for learning about and implementing various data structures using Python.

## Features

- Implementation of widely-used data structures including:
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
  - Graphs
  - Hash Tables
  - Heaps
  - and more!
- Detailed explanations of each data structure's properties, operations, and time complexity analysis.
- Well-structured Python code with clear comments and documentation.
- Extensive example usage showcasing how to create, manipulate, and use each data structure effectively.
- Test cases to ensure the correctness of the implementations.
- Beginner-friendly and educational for programmers of all levels.

## Installation

To use the data structures in this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/awesome-data-structures.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd awesome-data-structures
   ```

3. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Awesome Data Structures in Python.

## Usage

Each data structure is organized in its own module, making it easy to explore and understand. To use a specific data structure, import the corresponding module into your Python script or interactive session. Here's an example of how to use a linked list:

```python
from linked_list import LinkedList

# Create a new linked list
my_list = LinkedList()

# Add elements to the list
my_list.append(5)
my_list.append(10)
my_list.append(15)

# Print the list
print(my_list)  # Output: [5, 10, 15]

# Access the elements
print(my_list.get(1))  # Output: 10

# Remove an element
my_list.remove(10)

# Print the updated list
print(my_list)  # Output: [5, 15]
```

Feel free to explore the other data structures in a similar manner!
