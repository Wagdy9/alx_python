# Python Inheritance Project

Welcome to the Python Inheritance Project! This project aims to demonstrate the concept of inheritance in object-oriented programming using Python. 

## Project Overview

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that enables the creation of classes based on existing classes, allowing the derived classes to reuse and extend the attributes and methods of base classes. This project explores inheritance by providing an example of a simple hierarchy of classes.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

1. `main.py`: This is the main script where you can run the program. It contains the necessary code to showcase the usage of inheritance.
2. `animal.py`: This module defines the base class `Animal`. It contains common attributes and methods that will be inherited by the derived classes.
3. `mammal.py`: This module defines the derived class `Mammal`, which inherits from `Animal`. It adds specific attributes and methods related to mammals.
4. `bird.py`: This module defines the derived class `Bird`, which also inherits from `Animal`. It adds specific attributes and methods related to birds.

## Usage

To run the program, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and execute the `main.py` file using the Python interpreter: 

```shell
python main.py
```

The program will then demonstrate the usage of inheritance and showcase various features of the classes defined in `animal.py`, `mammal.py`, and `bird.py`. 

Feel free to modify the code in `main.py` or any of the modules to explore different scenarios and experiment with inheritance.
